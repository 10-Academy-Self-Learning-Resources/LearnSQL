### Creating tables in tutorialspoint

Creating a basic table involves naming the table and defining its columns and each column's data type.

The SQL CREATE TABLE statement is used to create a new table.

Syntax
The basic syntax of the CREATE TABLE statement is as follows −

CREATE TABLE table_name(
   column1 datatype,
   column2 datatype,
   column3 datatype,
   .....
   columnN datatype,
   PRIMARY KEY( one or more columns )
);

### Code TutPlus DB relationships
When creating a database, common sense dictates that we use separate tables for different types of entities. Some examples are: customers, orders, items, messages etc... But we also need to have relationships between these tables. For instance, customers make orders, and orders contain items. These relationships need to be represented in the database. Also, when fetching data with SQL, we need to use certain types of JOIN queries to get what we need.

There are several types of database relationships. Today we are going to cover the following:

1. One to One Relationships
2. One to Many and Many to One Relationships
3. Many to Many Relationships
4. Self Referencing Relationships

### 365DataScience Explanation of SQL Tables Relationship
We’re now entering the concept of relationships between tables in SQL. You will feel more comfortable reading this tutorial if you are familiar with and the primary,
foreign and unique keys. This is a tutorial in which we will illustrate that these relationships can be categorized. 
We will not explore all types in detail given that this topic is rather theoretical and time-consuming in its entirety. 
Instead, we will study the main types of relationships between the tables you will likely need in your workplace.

### Types of Relationship in SQL
One of the most important things in databases is to understand the types of relations in the databases. 
That stands for both – a process of designing a database model as well as when you’re analyzing your data.
Understanding these relations is somehow natural and not so complex but is still essential in the database theory (and practice).
