### Putting it together
The Intermediate SQL Tutorial
Welcome to the Intermediate SQL Tutorial! If you skipped the Basic SQL Tutorial, you should take a quick peek at this page to get an idea of how to use Mode's SQL editor to get the most out of this tutorial. For convenience, here's the gist:

Open another window to Mode. Sign up for an account if you don't have one.
For each lesson, start by running SELECT * on the relevant dataset so you get a sense of what the raw data looks like. Do this in that window you just opened to Mode.
Run all of the code blocks in the lesson in Mode in the other window. You'll learn more if you really examine the results and understand what the code is doing.
